                <h3>Pros of the Community</h3>
                <p>VALORANT features a lot of good sides that helped its rise into the gaming world and the most 
                    important one is its dedication towards its community. From beginners and casual players to 
                    professional esports teams, this game has attracted players of all skill levels. 
                    It is easy to notice teamwork among players, making it easy to find friends to team up

                <h3>Cons of the Community</h3>
                <p>Like any other online gaming community, VALORANT is no exception when it comes to toxic and 
                    inappropriate behavior during game sessions. Players can be very competitive that it leads 
                    them to output unnecessary unkind comments, so it is very important to keep a light mind 
                    towards mean behavior and pressing the mute and report functions built in the game when necessary.</p>

                <h3>Learning Curve Can Be Challenging</h3>
                <p>VALORANT’s learning curve can be quite rough on beginners, mainly newcomers into the tactical shooter genre. 
                    Becoming very good at VALORANT in one night is not something that we should expect when we start playing. 
                    This game contains many complex elements to learn, it has agent abilities, map layouts, and teamwork. 
                    All of that takes time to practice and learn. Noticing your improvement in these games is very satisfying, 
                    so if you’re willing to invest the effort, the journey is  definitely rewarding.

                <p>I’ve been following and playing this game since the closed-beta release. Four eventful years, filled
                    with amazing acquaintances and laughter mixed with rage towards this game. Valorant taught me how to
                    stay disciplined and patient no matter how stressful the situation can get. It also proved to me
                    that learning and getting better takes time. Whether you are a sweaty competitive gamer, a casual
                    player or a content creator, Valorant will always find a way to suit your liking.</p>
